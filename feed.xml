    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Soon, the search to find the answers to the most common questions about the city of Charlotte will become a solid streamlined and user-friendly process. Code for America's Charlotte Brigade, Code for Charlotte is working to create a new government website for the citizens of Charlotte that's simple, clean and resident-focused.  It's all part of a project called - &lt;em&gt;Charlotte Answers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, July 12, a group of writers convened for Code for Charlotte's first ever Write-A-Thon at &lt;a href="industrycharlotte.com"&gt;Industry Charlotte&lt;/a&gt; to write content for &lt;em&gt;Charlotte Answers&lt;/em&gt;. The event gave non-tech people a real chance to get involved with the group's tech-focused initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a brief look at one attendees experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I've been following Code for Charlotte's efforts for a while, but stayed away from events because my technical skills are not as strong as others'. But the Write-a-thon fit much better with my background as someone who has written a lot about things happening in Charlotte and local government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The format was very easy and straight-forward. I liked being able to brainstorm any and every question we'd want to know about how to do things in Charlotte. And while we were typing more than talking, it was interesting watching everyone build on each other's ideas. Then we all worked to find answers to the questions we'd come up with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The responses aren't terribly long, and I like that most link to another site or telephone number where you can learn even more about whatever topic you're interested in. There are a lot of sites with good information about Charlotte. This project hopefully will just make it easier to find what you're looking for. I hope to be able to help out more in the coming months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;April Bethea, Online Producer, The Charlotte Observer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of the questions answered were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does Charlotte offer for art lovers?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I apply for a business license?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why is there a stormwater fee?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers were written as if a neighbor was answering them and they will be reviewed for accuracy. Moving forward, there are many more questions for inquiring minds to know in our community.  If you want to get involved with the &lt;em&gt;Charlotte Answers&lt;/em&gt; project, please join us at our next monthly Hack Night on Monday, July 28th from 5:30-9:30 p.m. at 809, 809 W. Hill Street, Ste D, Charlotte, NC, 28208. &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Charlotte/events/168731222/"&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open Data - Tobin Bradley</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tobin is a GIS developer in Mecklenburg County.  He claims to "pretend" to develop software, but anybody who's got apps in production is a developer to us!  He is responsible for the first real open data in Mecklenburg County (and still the preponderance of county Open Data), available &lt;a href="http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/openmapping/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He provided &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/NjJXv2"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of GIS-related open data tools and
then proceeded through a short training session.  Some of the information is
available at that link (which also allows for comments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to metion some additional data that came up during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nconemap.com/"&gt;NC One Map&lt;/a&gt;: Twyla will be a good ambassador to
 the maintainers of this project.  I don't have the acronym handy, but she's
 part of the "GIS Council of Elders" that maintain this asset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out OpenStreetMap's progression in Haiti after the earthquake there.
 &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/eYCJ08V"&gt;After earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/KuByKij"&gt;2 days later&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://imgur.com/3kzNhjn"&gt;3 weeks later&lt;/a&gt; â€“ Open data saved lives in Haiti.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Base maps and overlay are the components of geographic data.  The base maps
 are the images of the territory, and the affiliated data comprises the overlay.
 You probably only want to create base maps if you are a real pro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The non-GIS specialists may want to pay special attention to &lt;a href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;, a JavaScript library that supports geographic information presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tobin uses &lt;a href="http://geoserver.org/"&gt;GeoServer&lt;/a&gt; and Digital Ocean to serve "massive" GeoJSON / KML etc. representations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free accounts are available at ARCGis, Google, and MapBox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that data is half of the code/data battle!&lt;/p&gt;
