Soon, the search to find the answers to the most common questions about the city of Charlotte will become a solid streamlined and user-friendly process. Code for America's Charlotte Brigade, Code for Charlotte is working to create a new government website for the citizens of Charlotte that's simple, clean and resident-focused.  It's all part of a project called - *Charlotte Answers*.

On Saturday, July 12, a group of writers convened for Code for Charlotte's first ever Write-A-Thon at [Industry Charlotte](industrycharlotte.com) to write content for *Charlotte Answers*. The event gave non-tech people a real chance to get involved with the group's tech-focused initiatives.

Here's a brief look at one attendees experience:

_I've been following Code for Charlotte's efforts for a while, but stayed away from events because my technical skills are not as strong as others'. But the Write-a-thon fit much better with my background as someone who has written a lot about things happening in Charlotte and local government._

*The format was very easy and straight-forward. I liked being able to brainstorm any and every question we'd want to know about how to do things in Charlotte. And while we were typing more than talking, it was interesting watching everyone build on each other's ideas. Then we all worked to find answers to the questions we'd come up with.*

*The responses aren't terribly long, and I like that most link to another site or telephone number where you can learn even more about whatever topic you're interested in. There are a lot of sites with good information about Charlotte. This project hopefully will just make it easier to find what you're looking for. I hope to be able to help out more in the coming months.*

- April Bethea, Online Producer, The Charlotte Observer

Some examples of the questions answered were:

* What does Charlotte offer for art lovers?
* How do I apply for a business license?
* Why is there a stormwater fee?

The answers were written as if a neighbor was answering them and they will be reviewed for accuracy. Moving forward, there are many more questions for inquiring minds to know in our community.  If you want to get involved with the *Charlotte Answers* project, please join us at our next monthly Hack Night on Monday, July 28th from 5:30-9:30 p.m. at 809, 809 W. Hill Street, Ste D, Charlotte, NC, 28208. [Sign up here.](http://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Charlotte/events/168731222/)
